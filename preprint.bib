title={Exponentially Slow Heating in Short and Long-range Interacting Floquet Systems},
url={http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.01620},
abstractNote={We analyze the dynamics of periodically-driven (Floquet) Hamiltonians with short- and long-range interactions, finding clear evidence for a thermalization time, $tau^*$, that increases exponentially with the drive frequency. We observe this behavior, both in systems with short-ranged interactions, where our results are consistent with rigorous bounds, and in systems with long-range interactions, where such bounds do not exist at present. Using a combination of heating and entanglement dynamics, we explicitly extract the effective energy scale controlling the rate of thermalization. Finally, we demonstrate that for times shorter than $tau^*$, the dynamics of the system is well-approximated by evolution under a time-independent Hamiltonian $D_{mathrm{eff}}
$, for both short- and long-range interacting systems.},

title={An improved Lieb-Robinson bound for many-body Hamiltonians with power-law interactions},
url={http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06369},
abstractNote={In this work, we prove a new family of Lieb-Robinson bounds for lattice spin systems with long-range interactions. Our results apply for arbitrary $k$-body interactions, so long as they decay with a power-law greater than $kd$, where $d$ is the dimension of the system. More precisely, we require that the sum of the norm of terms with diameter greater than or equal to $R$, acting on any one site, decays as a power-law $1/R^alpha$, with $alpha > d$. These new bounds allow us to prove that, at any fixed time, the spatial decay of quantum information follows arbitrarily closely to $1/r^{alpha}$. Moreover, we define a new light-cone for power-law interacting quantum systems, which captures the region of the system where changing the Hamiltonian can affect the evolution of a local operator. In short-range interacting systems, this light-cone agrees with the conventional definition. However, in long-range interacting systems, our definition yields a stricter light-cone, which is more relevant in most physical contexts.},

title={Imaging stress and magnetism at high pressures using a nanoscale quantum sensor},
url={http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.08796},
abstractNote={Pressure alters the physical, chemical and electronic properties of matter. The development of the diamond anvil cell (DAC) enables tabletop experiments to investigate a diverse landscape of high-pressure phenomena ranging from the properties of planetary interiors to transitions between quantum mechanical phases. In this work, we introduce and utilize a novel nanoscale sensing platform, which integrates nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers directly into the culet (tip) of diamond anvils. We demonstrate the versatility of this platform by performing diffraction-limited imaging (~600 nm) of both stress fields and magnetism, up to pressures ~30 GPa and for temperatures ranging from 25-340 K. For the former, we quantify all six (normal and shear) stress components with accuracy $<0.01$ GPa, offering unique new capabilities for characterizing the strength and effective viscosity of solids and fluids under pressure. For the latter, we demonstrate vector magnetic field imaging with dipole accuracy $<10^{-11}$ emu, enabling us to measure the pressure-driven $alphaleftrightarrowepsilon$ phase transition in iron as well as the complex pressure-temperature phase diagram of gadolinium. In addition to DC vector magnetometry, we highlight a complementary NV-sensing modality using T1 noise spectroscopy; crucially, this demonstrates our ability to characterize phase transitions even in the absence of static magnetic signatures. By integrating an atomic-scale sensor directly into DACs, our platform enables the in situ imaging of elastic, electric and magnetic phenomena at high pressures.},

title={Emergent hydrodynamics in Floquet quantum systems},
url={http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01859},
abstractNote={A tremendous amount of recent attention has focused on characterizing the dynamical properties of periodically driven many-body systems. Here, we use a novel numerical tool termed `density matrix truncation’ (DMT) to investigate the late-time dynamics of large-scale Floquet systems. We find that DMT accurately captures two essential pieces of Floquet physics, namely, prethermalization and late-time heating to infinite temperature. At large system sizes (up to L=100), DMT provides a powerful method for investigating the emergence of hydrodynamics in strongly correlated Floquet systems. In particular, by implementing a spatially inhomogenous drive, we demonstrate that an interplay between heating and diffusion is crucial to understanding the dynamics of the system. The resulting evolution of the local energy density is captured by a simple hydrodynamical equation, demonstrating that high frequency Floquet systems can exhibit classical hydrodynamics at late times, despite the heating process being intrinsically quantum mechanical.},
